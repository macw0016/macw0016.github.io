           <p><font size= "+2">Hello! My name is <strong>Drishti Macwan.</strong>  I am from <em>Anand, Gujarat</em> which is known as <q>the milk city of India.</q>
             I graduated 12<sup>th</sup> grade last year and currently I am in my first semester of Interactive Media Design.
             I am pretty excited to learn and develop new skills from all the courses. I am looking forward to coming over to Canada and beginning the new phase of my life there.</font> </p> 
            
            
             <p><font size= "+2"> I have been passionate about art since I was kid as it runs in my family.  Over the years i have learned different forms of art and 
                would want to continue to do the same. I like to use my <em>artistic talents</em> to develop technical skills and an ability to solve problems 
                creatively. I consider myself an adventurous person.  In 2019, on my trip to Manali I tried Paragliding and Rafting, it was so fun!I look forward to experiencing
                more adventures like Sky Diving, Camping,<abbr title= "self contained underwater breathing apparatus">  Scuba</abbr> diving and much more.</font></p>
